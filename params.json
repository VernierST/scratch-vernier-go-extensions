  "body": "# Introduction\r\nUse data from Vernier [Go!Temp](http://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/temperature-sensors/go-temp/) and [Go!Motion](http://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/motion-detectors/go-mot/) sensors to bring real world data into your Scratch projects.\r\n\r\n* Use the Go!Temp extension to obtain a real-time temperature reading from a connected Go!Temp probe.\r\n* Use the Go!Motion extension to obtain a real-time position reading from a connected Go!Motion device.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\n## Install the Scratch Extensions Browser Plugin\r\nYou will need to use the Firefox web browser for this extension to work.\r\nDownload and install the [Scratch Extensions Browser Plugin](https://scratch.mit.edu/info/ext_download/) for \"other web browsers\"\r\n\r\n*There is an issue with the Chrome version of the Scratch Extensions Browser Plugin that prevents the Vernier Go! extensions from working properly in the Chrome web browser on Mac OS X.*\r\n\r\n## Load the extension\r\nLaunch one of the Vernier Go! extensions by going to one of the following URLs:\r\n\r\n**Go!Temp**  \r\nhttp://scratchx.org/?url=http://verniersoftwaretechnology.github.io/scratch-vernier-go-extensions/go_temp_extension.js\r\n\r\n**Go!Motion**  \r\nhttp://scratchx.org/?url=http://verniersoftwaretechnology.github.io/scratch-vernier-go-extensions/go_motion_extension.js\r\n\r\n## Connect your Go! device\r\nConnect the USB cable of your Go! device to your computer. \r\n\r\n## Wait for the green light\r\nWhen you see the indicator light in the \"More Blocks\" tab turn green you are ready to start using the extension. The green LED on the Go! device should also be lit.\r\n\r\n## Collect the data\r\nNow the Go! device should be generating a real-time measurement two times every second and you can integrate quantities of temperature or distance into your Scratch projects.\r\n\r\n## Sample Projects\r\nThere are also a few sample projects that demonstrate how to integrate real world physical measurements into your Scratch projects. Just click one of the following URLs:\r\n\r\n* [SayTemp](http://scratchx.org/?url=http://verniersoftwaretechnology.github.io/scratch-vernier-go-extensions/examples/SayTemp.sbx)\r\n* [DrawTemp](http://scratchx.org/?url=http://verniersoftwaretechnology.github.io/scratch-vernier-go-extensions/examples/DrawTemp.sbx)\r\n* [SayMotion](http://scratchx.org/?url=http://verniersoftwaretechnology.github.io/scratch-vernier-go-extensions/examples/SayMotion.sbx)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Authors and Contributors\r\nThis page and the Go! Device extensions are maintained by Vernier Software & Technology (@VernierSoftwareTechnology).
